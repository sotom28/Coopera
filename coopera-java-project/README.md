## Usage Guidelines

- **CooperaController**: This class handles incoming HTTP requests. You can access the following endpoints:
  - `GET /items`: Retrieves all items.
  - `GET /items/{id}`: Retrieves a specific item by its ID.

- **CooperaService**: This class contains the business logic for managing items. It interacts with the repository to perform operations like finding all items or finding an item by ID.

- **CooperaRepository**: This interface extends Spring Data's repository interface, providing methods for data access, including saving and deleting items.
